Regression Testing plan:

This regression test plan to be implemented in new builds of this system must pass the following analysis:

1-Functional and Non-Functional Requirements
2-Risks for API REST
3-Integrations
4-Test environment
5-Test Approaches
6-Tools
7-Timelines and Responsibility of team
8-Test Automation

I wrote in the test plan what would be tested (see PNG image) through an agile team, the plan would be maintained through a folder of files edited in Visual Studio Code (VSC) and integrated with the team using GITHUB.

The QA team will work on regression testing at each phase of the SDLC:
For example, doing the requirements analysis, budget, specifications expected by the customer, the current structure, the project schedule.
Through Resource Planning, costs, time, benefits and other items must be considered at this stage. In the Design and Project stage, they must verify the specifications, resources and necessary operations that will be present in the proposed system requirements.

Together with the development team in Coding and programming tools, interpreters and debugger to generate and implement the codes. Mainly performing Quality Control Tests (unit, integration and E2E), reporting defects. Providing feedback on deployment with staff and in Maintenance, resolving bugs, updating the system to new versions, and improving when new features are added.
